"""
Tier 3 staging driver: a Telegram USER client that drives the staging bridge over
REAL Telegram and asserts on the bot's replies.

Why a user account and not a bot: bots never receive other bots' messages, so a bot
could not talk to the bridge. This logs in as the dedicated test account (via the
StringSession from gen_session.py), DMs the staging bot, and checks what comes back.

Deterministic by default: run-staging.sh points the staging bridge's CLAUDE_BIN at
test/claude-stub.ts, so the model layer is canned and replies are stable ("okReply").
Set STAGING_REAL_CLAUDE=1 to instead exercise the real `claude` with a compliance
prompt (a looser, non-hermetic smoke test).

Env (set by run-staging.sh from .env.staging):
    TG_API_ID, TG_API_HASH, TG_TEST_SESSION   — the user client's credentials
    STAGING_BOT_USERNAME                       — @username of the staging bot to DM
    STAGING_REPLY_TIMEOUT                       — seconds to wait per reply (default 60)
    STAGING_REAL_CLAUDE                         — "1" to test against real claude
